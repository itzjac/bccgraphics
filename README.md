# Computer Graphics 101

This course will help you to understand the mathematics and algorithms necessary to perform
real time 3D graphics using a modern 3D API like OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan.


Requisites
 * Linear algebra
 * Calculus
 * Data structure and algorithms
 * C and C++
 * Optimizing CPU programs


What this course is NOT about
 * Specifics on how to use a 3D API like Direct3D, Vulkan or OpenGL
 * Specifics on how to program in C or C++, or any other low level language, though is mandatory previous experience on any of those languages
